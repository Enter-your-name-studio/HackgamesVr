Space fighter simulator with realistic controls for Hackgames VR jam. Protect mothership from waves of pirates, upgrade between waves and find all 5 easter eggs. Seated playing only.

Containts in-game tutorial. All game in English, it's just trailer with Ukrainian translation.

Requires SteamVR to launch. Tested only with WMR, but I pretty sure that it works with all SteamVR supported headsets.
